Fraud detection is the process of identifying deceptive or malicious activities that aim to exploit systems for illegal gain. In the realm of mobile applications, fraud can take various formsâ€”such as fake reviews, misleading app behavior, hidden malware, or cloned applications designed to trick users. These fraudulent apps can result in data theft, financial loss, or privacy breaches.To counter this, modern fraud detection systems leverage data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing user reviews, behavioral patterns, and app metadata, these systems can detect inconsistencies and red flags that signal potential fraud. The goal is to ensure user safety, uphold platform integrity, and reduce the spread of harmful or deceptive apps.In this project, FraudGuard applies sentiment analysis and classification models to app reviews, allowing it to automatically label applications as either legitimate or fraudulent. This helps users and developers make informed decisions based on intelligent, data-driven insights.
