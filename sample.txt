Hands down the worst app I’ve ever used.
It crashes every time I try to open it, and when it actually works, the features are completely useless.
The layout is confusing and outdated, and customer service is non-existent. 
I regret downloading it and will be deleting it immediately.
do yourself a favor and avoid this disaster.


I absolutely love this app! It’s super user-friendly and makes everything so much easier.
The design is sleek, and I love how fast it works.
I’ve been using it for weeks now, and it’s made a real difference in my daily routine.
Highly recommend to anyone looking to simplify their life!
